# Iris-App
Iris Species Classification Web App using Streamlit( Support Vector Machines )
Data Description
The dataset used in the problem statement, popularly known as Iris Dataset or Fisher's Dataset, is published by UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of Iris flower namely:

1.Iris-setosa

2.Iris-virginica

3.Iris-versicolor

The big idea is that based on the length and width of sepals and petals of a flower, can we build a classification model that tells us the species of a particular Iris flower? The answer is "yes, we can".
